# Energy price prediction

AI application to forecast electricity price: 
This is an unsupervised ML model capable of predicting the electricity prices in the Brazilian market. 
We managed to create a tool capable of outperforming the current process (based on people's expertise) 
and able to keep improving and adapting to new scenarios. 

The prediction of the future price of the energy is important because the contracts are signed in advance and 
the value agreed doesnÂ´t change regardless of the actual price in the future is higher or lower than the one defined
in the contract.
